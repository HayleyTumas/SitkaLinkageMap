This folder contains code to convert GenomeStudio files to vcf files and filter those files for linkage mapping (Filter folder).
This was run on the raw genotype data produced by the SNP Chip which is only available upon request. 
The folder also contains bash scripts for developing a linkage map in LepMap3. 
LepMap3 code was run on a vcf of the filtered SNP Chip genotypes. A SNP table of these genotypes 
and code on how to convert the table to a vcf for LepMap3 is available in a Dryad repository that accompanies this publication.
