This folder contains bash scripts for developing a linkage map in LepMap3 from a file that combines RAD Seq and SNP Chip genotype data. 
A SNP table of these genotypes and code on how to convert the table to a vcf for LepMap3 is available in a Dryad repository that accompanies 
this publication. Individual SNP Chip and RAD Seq files also exist and individual folders on how to make those maps. Begin at the Data_Convert file
and follow the LepMap3 wiki for guidance (https://sourceforge.net/p/lep-map3/wiki/LM3%20Home/).
Code exists for making maps for each of the two full-sib families and a map that combines the families, using family 2 to inform the separate chromosome
step. Code and data also shows how the map was then filtered for markers that disagreed between component maps (see publication) and code to make the
map again without these "Problem Markers".
